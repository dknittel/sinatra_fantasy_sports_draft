materialize for css

heroku

JS:
ajax login and register
JUST HIDE THE BUTTON INSTEAD OF THE 

rspec:
write rspec tests

Pure:
Get css and html template from pure website

put a "select number of players per team" input on drafts/new page
fix the fact that you have to click the text instead of the button on buttons

Note:
value field in input in a post form is what is gonna be displayed
Must require json to get json in ajax to work
DONT NEED TO DROP DATABASE ANYMORE!

Bugs:
<!-- INSTEAD OF USING THE TEAM'S ID, YOU NEED TO USE DRAFT POSITION AND USE THE CURRENT TEAM FROM THE DRAFT TABLE TO FIND THE TEAM. THIS WILL FIX THE FACT THAT CURRENT TEAM HAS TO BE SET TO THE FIRST TEAM'S ID
for second draft, it won't end when all the teams are full -->
rspec not working
NO! because stu had me do "@draft.draftees.create" to make the draftees -> draftees shouldn't have draft id cuz teams have it already?

Tables: (done)
User has many drafts
draft has many teams
draft has many draftees
team has many draftees, but draftees start not in team
pool has many drafts
pool has many players
players has many draftees

Table attributes: (done)
state in the draft which is current team to pick
draft has a state that knows the order of teams based on their ids

Routes: (done)
setup should be drafts/new => drafts, then drafts/id

Logic: (done)
when all teams have 7 players, the draft ends (Loop through each team doing: Players.where(team_id: @team.id).count
 OR none of the Teams have a nil in any of their player attributes if you go that route)
Have a way to create team names
Need way to determine avilable players for jquery stuff: Player.where(team_id: nil)


Register: (done)
create authentication for passwords
